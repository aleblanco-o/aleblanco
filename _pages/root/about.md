# About Ale

Hey, Iâ€™m Alejandro. For several years, I tried to find the right way to collect my ideas and projects. After giving in to the relentless variability of structures that torment my mind, I ended up building this space. Here are a few links to explore:

This webpage is based on [this template available on GitHub](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). The colors and structure are inspired by [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com), founder and CEO of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
