# Aroma

Your scent is not ordinary,

it is, in its simplicity, both striking and harmonious.

Your scent is not unusual, on the contrary, it is even familiar.

For your scent not only reminds me of the emptiness of the living world, but also of the rays of light that greet the morning dew.

Your scent, which, even if they call me mad, feels so familiar to me, smells just as I had imagined it.

Your scent, which no longer belongs to me and never did.

Today, in a room filled with perfume, the delicate notes of your presence still linger.

Your scent, which, if I dared to dream again, smells like, in another life, I promised to find youâ€”and at last, I have.
