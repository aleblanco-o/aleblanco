# Blind

I think I’ve gone blind, for I can’t find the courage to look them in the eyes. 
I ask your shadow, how can I lie and say I love them, 
when you, only you, gave me the purest love I’ve ever known?

You set me free, 
pulled me out of fear, 
and showed me the path to live in truth. 

You taught me to love myself, 
to embrace who I am, 
to breathe without chains, 
without pain.

But I think I’ve gone blind, 
because in finding myself, 
I’ve lost your eyes.
